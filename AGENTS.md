# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

# shadcn/ui rules

This project uses Next.js with React, shadcn/ui, and Tailwind CSS.

Use pnpm for all package management commands. Do not use npm, yarn, or bun unless explicitly requested.

Use the Base UI variant of shadcn/ui components by default. Do not add Radix UI dependencies, imports, or component variants unless the existing project configuration already uses Radix UI or the task explicitly asks for Radix.

Before adding a shadcn/ui component, inspect `components.json`, `package.json`, and the existing files under `components/ui/`.
<!-- END:shadcn-agent-rules -->

<!-- BEGIN:when-writing-code -->
# Code writing rules

Before writing new code, inspect existing pages and components to match the current code style, page structure, visual design, naming patterns, and Tailwind usage.

Prefer shadcn/ui components when they fit the use case. Check the latest available shadcn/ui components before creating custom UI from scratch.

Use Tailwind CSS carefully and consistently. Keep spacing, typography, colors, borders, radius, shadows, and responsive behavior aligned across pages and components.
